=============================================================================================================================
Step 1: Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
#Quick Start -> Selection of the OS 
#My Amis -> Selection from the archived OS with configuraitons 
#AWS Marketplace-> Market place where other and aws peoples has already customies the os configuraitons and some are free and some are paid 
#Community AMIs->we can get the os from different communites 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2: Choose an Instance Type
#Family (Compute optimized,GPU compute,General purpose,Memory optimized,Storage optimized)
#Type(nano,micro,small,large,xlarge)
#CPU(1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128)
#RAM Memoary(0.5,1,2,3.75,4,7.5,8,15,15,25,16,30,30.5,32,60,61,64,122,244,256,488,723,976,1952)
#Internal Storage(EBS,1 x 4 (SSD),2 x 16 (SSD),1 x 32 (SSD),1 x 32 (SSD),1 x 60 (SSD)
,2 x 40 (SSD),2 x 40 (SSD),1 x 80 (SSD),2 x 80 (SSD),2 x 80 (SSD),1 x 160 (SSD),2 x 120 (SSD),2 x 160 (SSD),1 x 320 (SSD),2 x 320 (SSD)
,2 x 320 (SSD),1 x 800 (SSD),2 x 800 (SSD),1 x 1920,4 x 800 (SSD),2 x 1920,3 x 2048,8 x 800 (SSD),6 x 2048,12 x 2048,24 x 2048)
#EBS OPTIMIZATION (YES,NO)
#NETWORK PERFORMANCE(LOW TO MODRATE,MODRATE,HIGHT,10GB,20GB)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3: Configure Instance Details
#Number of instances
#Purchasing option(Instances,Spot Requests,Reserved Instances,Scheduled Instances,Dedicated Hosts)
#Network(VPC)
#Subnet(public,private subnet)
#Auto-assign Public IP(Requests a public IP address from Amazon's public IP address pool, to make your 
                     instance reachable from the Internet. In most cases, the public IP address 
					 is associated with the instance until it’s stopped or terminated, after which 
					 it’s no longer available for you to use. If you require a persistent public IP 
					 address that you can associate and disassociate at will, use an Elastic IP address 
					 (EIP) instead. You can allocate your own EIP, and associate it to your instance after launch.)
#IAM role (IAM roles for EC2 automatically deploys and rotates AWS credentials for you, removing the need 
         to store your AWS access keys with your application. Select the instance profile that contains 
		 the required IAM role. If you created your IAM role using the console, the instance profile 
		 has the same name as your IAM role. )
#Shutdown behavior(stop,terminate)
#Enable termination protection(You can protect instances from being accidentally terminated. Once enabled, 
                                          you won't be able to terminate this instance via the API or the 
                              AWS Management Console until termination protection has been disabled.)
#Monitoring(Enables you to monitor, collect, and analyze metrics about your instances through Amazon CloudWatch.
            Additional charges apply if you enable this option.)
#Advanced Details(You can specify user data to configure an instance or run a configuration script during launch. 
                 If you launch more than one instance at a time, the user data is available to 
				 all the instances in that reservation.)
				 As text, As file, Input is already base64 encoded
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4: Add Storage 
Note:Free tier eligible customers can get up to 30 GB of EBS General Purpose (SSD) or Magnetic storage.
#Volume Type (Amazon EBS is a block-level storage volume that persists independently from the lifetime 
              of an EC2 instance, so you can stop and restart your instance at a later time.
			  Ephemeral instance store volumes are physically attached to the host computer.
			  The data on an instance store persists only during the lifetime of the instance.)
			  root volume is the main volume for any instance 
#Device (The available device names for the volume. Depending on the block device driver of the selected AMI's kernel, 
          the device may be attached with a different name than what you specify)
#Snapshot (A snapshot is a backup of an EC2 volume that's stored in S3. 
           You can create a new volume using data stored in a snapshot by entering the 
		   snapshot's ID. You can search for public snapshots by typing text in the 
		   Snapshot field. Descriptions are case-sensitive.)
#Size (GiB)(Volume size must be greater than zero or the size of the snapshot used.
             Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes must be at least 4 GiB in size.)
#Volume Type (General Purpose (SSD) volumes can burst to 3000 IOPS, and deliver a 
              consistent baseline of 3 IOPS/GiB. Provisioned IOPs (SSD) volumes can
			  deliver up to 20000 IOPS, and are best for EBS-optimized instances. 
			  Magnetic volumes, previously called standard volumes, 
			  deliver 100 IOPS on average, and can burst to hundreds of IOPS)
#IOPS      (The requested number of I/O operations per second that the volume can support. 
            For Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes, you can provision up to 50 IOPS per GiB. 
			For General Purpose (SSD) volumes, baseline performance is 3 IOPS per GiB, 
			with a minimum of 100 IOPS and a maximum of 10000 IOPS. 
			General Purpose (SSD) volumes under 1000 GiB can burst up to 3000 IOPS)
#Throughput (MB/s) (Throughput that the volume can support is specified for Streaming Optimized volumes: ST1 and SC1)
#Delete on Termination(EBS volumes persist independently from the running life of an EC2 instance. However, 
                        you can choose to automatically delete an EBS volume when the associated instance is terminated.)
#Encrypted(Volumes that are created from encrypted snapshots are automatically encrypted, and volumes that are created 
          from unencrypted snapshots are automatically unencrypted. 
		  If no snapshot is selected, you can choose to encrypt the volume.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5: Add Tags
A tag consists of a case-sensitive key-value pair.Up to 50 tags maximum
Key (127 characters maximum)
Value (255 characters maximum)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6: Configure Security Group
A security group is a set of firewall rules that control the traffic for your instance. On this page,
you can add rules to allow specific traffic to reach your instance.

#Assign a security group(create new / choose exisiting )
#Security group name: name of the security group 
#Description: description of the security group
#Type (ssh,tcp,cutom rules,http,https,pop,ldap,smtp)
#Protocoll (TCP,UDP)
#Port Range
#Source(custom,myip,anywhere)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
