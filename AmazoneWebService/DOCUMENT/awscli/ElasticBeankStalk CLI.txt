Configure the EB CLI
-----------------------------------
1.EB CLI prompts you to select a region

$ eb $ eb init

Select a default region
1) us-east-1 : US East (N. Virginia)
2) us-west-1 : US West (N. California)
3) us-west-2 : US West (Oregon)
4) eu-west-1 : EU (Ireland)
5) eu-central-1 : EU (Frankfurt)
6) ap-south-1 : Asia Pacific (Mumbai)
7) ap-southeast-1 : Asia Pacific (Singapore)
8) ap-southeast-2 : Asia Pacific (Sydney)
9) ap-northeast-1 : Asia Pacific (Tokyo)
10) ap-northeast-2 : Asia Pacific (Seoul)
11) sa-east-1 : South America (Sao Paulo)
12) cn-north-1 : China (Beijing)
13) us-east-2 : US East (Columbus)
14) ca-central-1 : Canada (Central)
15) eu-west-2 : EU (London)
(default is 3): 3

2. provide your access key and secret key 

You have not yet set up your credentials or your credentials are incorrect
You must provide your credentials.
(aws-access-id): AKIAJOUAASEXAMPLE
(aws-secret-key): 5ZRIrtTM4ciIAvd4EXAMPLEDtm+PiPSzpoK

3.An application in Elastic Beanstalk is a resource that contains a set of application versions (source), environments, and saved configurations that are associated with a single web application. Each time you deploy your source code to Elastic Beanstalk using the EB CLI, a new application version is created and added to the list.

Select an application to use
1) [ Create new Application ]
(default is 1): 1

4.The default application name is the name of the folder in which you run 
 $ eb init. Enter any name that describes your project.
 
Enter Application Name
(default is "eb"): eb
Application eb has been created.


5.Select a platform that matches the language or framework that your web application is developed in. If you haven't started developing an application yet, choose a platform that you are interested in. 

Select a platform.
1) Node.js
2) PHP
3) Python
4) Ruby
5) Tomcat
6) IIS
7) Docker
8) Multi-container Docker
9) GlassFish
10) Go
11) Java
(default is 1): 1


6.Choose yes to assign an SSH key pair to the instances in your Elastic Beanstalk environment, 
 allowing you to connect directly to them for troubleshooting.
 
 Do you want to set up SSH for your instances?
(y/n): y

7.Choose an existing key pair or create a new one. To use eb init to create a new key pair, you must have ssh-keygen installed on your local machine and available from the command line. The CLI registers the new key pair with Amazon EC2 for you and stores the private key locally in a folder named .ssh in your user directory.

Select a keypair.
1) [ Create new KeyPair ]
(default is 1): 1


Deploying an Artifact Instead of the Project Folder
-----------------------------------------------------------
EB CLI to deploy a ZIP or WAR file that you generate as part of a separate build process by adding the following lines to .elasticbeanstalk/config.yml in your project folder.

deploy:
  artifact: path/to/<buildartifact>.zip
 or 
deploy:
  artifact: target/<demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT>.jar
  
  
 Elastic Beanstalk Service Role
----------------------------------
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [

================================================================ 
Managing Elastic Beanstalk Environments with the EB CLI
================================================================ 
1. To create your first environment, run eb create and follow the prompts. If your project directory has source code in it, the EB CLI will bundle it up and deploy it to your environment. Otherwise, a sample application will be used.

$ eb create
Enter Environment Name
(default is eb-dev): eb-dev
Enter DNS CNAME prefix
(default is eb-dev): eb-dev
WARNING: The current directory does not contain any source code. Elastic Beanstalk is launching the sample application instead.
Environment details for: elasticBeanstalkExa-env
  Application name: elastic-beanstalk-example
  Region: us-west-2
  Deployed Version: Sample Application
  Environment ID: e-j3pmc8tscn
  Platform: 64bit Amazon Linux 2015.03 v1.4.3 running Docker 1.6.2
  Tier: WebServer-Standard
  CNAME: eb-dev.elasticbeanstalk.com
  Updated: 2015-06-27 01:02:24.813000+00:00
Printing Status:
INFO: createEnvironment is starting.
 -- Events -- (safe to Ctrl+C) Use "eb abort" to cancel the command.
 
2.Run eb status to see the current status of your environment. When the status is ready, the sample application is available at elasticbeanstalk.com and the environment is ready to be updated.

$ eb status
Environment details for: elasticBeanstalkExa-env
  Application name: elastic-beanstalk-example
  Region: us-west-2
  Deployed Version: Sample Application
  Environment ID: e-gbzqc3jcra
  Platform: 64bit Amazon Linux 2015.03 v1.4.3 running Docker 1.6.2

  Updated: 2015-06-30 01:47:45.589000+00:00
  Status: Ready
  Health: Green
  
3.Use the eb health command to view health information about the instances in your environment and the state of your environment overall. Use the --refresh option to view health in an interactive view that updates every 10 seconds.

~/eb$ eb health

4.Use eb events to see a list of events output by Elastic Beanstalk.
~/eb$ eb events
2015-06-29 23:21:09    INFO    createEnvironment is starting.
2015-06-29 23:21:10    INFO    Using elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-EXAMPLE as Amazon S3 storage bucket for environment data.
2015-06-29 23:21:23    INFO    Created load balancer named: awseb-e-g-AWSEBLoa-EXAMPLE
2015-06-29 23:21:42    INFO    Created security group named: awseb-e-gbzqc3jcra-stack-AWSEBSecurityGroup-EXAMPLE
2015-06-29 23:21:45    INFO    Created Auto Scaling launch configuration named: awseb-e-gbzqc3jcra-stack-AWSEBAutoScalingLaunchConfiguration-EXAMPLE
...

5.Use eb logs to pull logs from an instance in your environment. By default, eb logs pull logs from the first instance launched and displays them in standard output. You can specify an instance ID with the --instance option to get logs from a specific instance.

The --all option pulls logs from all instances and saves them to subdirectories under .elasticbeanstalk/logs.

$ eb logs --all
Retrieving logs...
Logs were saved to /home/local/ANT/mwunderl/ebcli/environments/test/.elasticbeanstalk/logs/150630_201410
Updated symlink at /home/local/ANT/mwunderl/ebcli/environments/test/.elasticbeanstalk/logs/latest


6.To open your environment's website in a browser, use eb open:

$ eb open

.Take a look at the configuration options available for your running environment with the eb config command:
$ eb config
ApplicationName: elastic-beanstalk-example
DateUpdated: 2015-06-30 02:12:03+00:00
EnvironmentName: elasticBeanstalkExa-env
SolutionStackName: 64bit Amazon Linux 2015.03 v1.4.3 running Docker 1.6.2
settings:
 ......................
 ......................

.use eb terminate to terminate it.
$ eb terminate
The environment "eb-dev" and all associated instances will be terminated.
To confirm, type the environment name: eb-dev
INFO: terminateEnvironment is starting.................
