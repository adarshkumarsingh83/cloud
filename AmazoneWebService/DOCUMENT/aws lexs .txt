Amazon Lex Concepts
=============================================================
Bot – A bot contains all of the components of a conversation.

Intent – An intent represents a goal that the bot’s user wants to achieve (buying a plane ticket, scheduling an appointment, or getting a weather forecast, and so forth).

Utterance – An utterance is a spoken or typed phrase that invokes an intent. “I want to book a hotel” or “I want to order flowers” are two simple utterances.

Slots – Each slot is a piece of data that the user must supply in order to fulfill the intent. Slots are typed; a travel bot could have slots for cities, states or airports.

Prompt – A prompt is a question that asks the user to supply some data (for a slot) that is needed to fulfill an intent.

Fulfillment – Fulfillment is the business logic that carries our the user’s intent. Lex supports the use of Lambda functions for fulfillment.

Bots, intents, and slots are versioned so that you can draw clear lines between development, testing, staging, and production, in a multi-developer environment. You can create multiple aliases for each of your bots and maps them to specific versions of the components.
